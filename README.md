# Java Pong Game

## Description
For this project, our group decided to make a spin-off of the classic and revolutionary Pong, made by Atari in 1972.
We decided on this game because although it is simple, allowing us to focus on following good object oriented design practices,
with close attention to the use of appropriate design patterns and complete testing, it also is different from previous projects and exercises we have done,
in the sense that we need to implement some features that were not formerly explored in our lectures, like the physics of the ball.
## List Of Features
- **Player vs. Player:** Engage in a head-to-head battle with a friend.
- **Responsive Controls:** Move your paddle up and down to hit the ball, be careful not to let it pass you or your opponent will score.
- **Realistic Ball Movement:** The ball will bounce off the walls in a realistic way, in the direction you would expect.
- **Score Tracking:** Keep track of the score for each player, the first to 11 wins.
- **Classic Pong Gameplay:** Experience the timeless gameplay of Pong with our own remake of this classic game!
